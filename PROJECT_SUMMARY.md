- Identifies items with low engagement
- Automatically relists to boost visibility
- Prevents re-relisting too frequently (7-day cooldown)
- Logs all relist attempts

‚úÖ **Offer Management** (Daily at 10 AM)
- Finds listings with watchers but no sales
- Calculates promotional pricing
- Tracks offer history
- Prevents offer spam (14-day cooldown)

‚úÖ **Feedback Automation** (Daily at 3 PM)
- Syncs sold items from eBay
- Identifies sales ready for feedback
- Sends automated requests
- Tracks feedback status

### Dashboard Features

‚úÖ **Real-Time Statistics**
- Active listings count
- Stale listings needing attention
- Total views and watchers
- Pending feedback requests
- Daily activity metrics

‚úÖ **Manual Controls**
- Trigger any automation on-demand
- Immediate feedback via notifications
- Progress indicators during operations

‚úÖ **Scheduled Jobs Monitor**
- View all scheduled tasks
- See next run times
- Monitor job configuration

‚úÖ **Activity Log Viewer**
- Filter by action type
- Status indicators (success/failed/skipped)
- Timestamps and details
- Pagination support

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

### Design Patterns Used

- **Separation of Concerns**: API, automation, scheduling, and UI are separate modules
- **Repository Pattern**: Database models handle data access
- **Factory Pattern**: Flask app initialization
- **Singleton Pattern**: Configuration management
- **Background Processing**: Scheduled tasks don't block web requests

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (lightweight, perfect for Raspberry Pi)
- **Database**: SQLite (zero-config, file-based)
- **Scheduling**: APScheduler (Python-native, reliable)
- **API Integration**: eBay SDK
- **Containerization**: Docker (consistent deployment)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (no build step needed)

### Performance Optimizations

- Minimal resource footprint (~100-200 MB RAM)
- Efficient database queries with indexes
- Lazy loading and pagination
- Background task processing
- Log rotation to prevent disk bloat

## üçì Raspberry Pi Compatibility

### Why It Works Great

‚úÖ **Low Resource Usage**
- Runs comfortably alongside Home Assistant
- Minimal CPU usage (tasks are API calls, not computation)
- Small memory footprint
- Efficient I/O with SQLite

‚úÖ **ARM Support**
- Docker image builds natively on ARM
- No cross-compilation needed
- Python runs great on ARM

‚úÖ **Reliability**
- Automatic restart on failure
- Health checks
- Graceful error handling
- Database persistence

### Resource Requirements

| Resource | Usage | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| RAM | 100-200 MB | Minimal |
| CPU | <5% average | Negligible |
| Disk | ~50 MB + data | Small |
| Network | Periodic API calls | Low bandwidth |

## üîê Security Considerations

‚úÖ **Credentials Protected**
- Environment variables (not hardcoded)
- .env file ignored by git
- No credentials in logs

‚úÖ **API Best Practices**
- OAuth token authentication
- Rate limiting respected
- Error handling prevents leaks

‚úÖ **Docker Security**
- Non-root user recommended (add to Dockerfile if needed)
- Private network by default
- Volume permissions controlled

## üöÄ Deployment Options

### Option 1: Raspberry Pi (Recommended for you)
```bash
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
cd ebay-tools
./setup.sh
```

### Option 2: Any Linux Server
```bash
git clone <repo>
cd ebay-tools
docker-compose up -d
```

### Option 3: Cloud (AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.)
Same as Option 2, but access via public IP or domain

## üìä What Happens Next

### First 24 Hours
1. Initial listing sync occurs
2. Database populated with your items
3. First scheduled tasks run overnight
4. Activity logs start accumulating

### Ongoing
- Hourly syncs keep data fresh
- Daily automations handle maintenance
- Dashboard shows real-time metrics
- Database grows with historical data

### Maintenance
- Check dashboard weekly
- Review logs monthly
- Backup database quarterly
- Update OAuth token as needed

## üéì How to Use

### Getting Started
1. Get eBay API credentials
2. Configure `.env` file
3. Run `./setup.sh`
4. Access dashboard at http://your-pi-ip:5001

### Daily Use
- Check dashboard for overview
- Review activity logs for actions taken
- Adjust settings based on results
- Use manual triggers when needed

### Optimization
- Monitor stale listing patterns
- Adjust timing based on your audience
- Fine-tune offer percentages

- [ ] API webhooks for external integrations

### Easy Wins
- Add more configurable thresholds

## üìù Notes on eBay API

### Limitations Handled
- Rate limits respected with scheduled tasks
- Error handling for all API calls
- Graceful degradation on failures
- Retry logic where appropriate

### Not Implemented (Limitations)
- Direct offer sending (eBay has restrictions)
- Bulk price changes (use eBay's tools)
- Messaging buyers (use eBay messaging center)
- Some features require eBay's promotional APIs
